Today is the second day of working in the company. I feel very nervous when I am working as a programmer for the first time. I don't know what to do. We are all very professional people. I still have a lot to learn and can't keep up with the progress of the company. Now I am still in the configuration development environment. It's very hard. My master doesn't tell me anything, I feel that he is also the first time to lead people to develop. I hope that the company that will work formally in the future will be a little better. This time, he is also in a hurry to find a job. Let's go ahead
